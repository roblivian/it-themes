dark theme for indietorrents gazelle, based on one of viker's mockups

strictly testing, just playing around at this point

NOTE: i picked a bad project name, as gazelle requires subdirectories of
styles/ to be lowercase, with spaces replaced by underscores.

for my test tracker, i just symlinked Indietorrents-dark-theme to 
indietorrents_dark_theme
